1. Selection & Description
The modern cultural work I selected for this reception project is the animated film Hercules (1997), produced by Walt Disney Pictures and directed by John Musker and Ron Clements. This film is a musical comedy that reimagines the myth of Herakles (Hercules in Roman mythology) for a family audience. I chose this work because it was one of my earliest exposures to Greek mythology, and revisiting it as a student of classical mythology reveals how much of the ancient story has been reshaped for modern storytelling. The film follows Hercules, a son of Zeus, who is stripped of his divine status as an infant and raised by mortal parents. As he grows, he seeks to regain his place among the gods by proving himself a "true hero."

2. Mythological Source
The myth adapted in Hercules is the life and labors of Herakles, a central figure in Greek mythology known for his superhuman strength and heroic exploits. In the original myth, Herakles is the son of Zeus and the mortal Alcmene. Hera, jealous of Zeus’s infidelity, torments Herakles throughout his life. After Hera drives him into a temporary madness, he kills his wife and children. To atone, he undertakes the Twelve Labors—an arduous series of challenges assigned by King Eurystheus. These labors form the core of Herakles’ mythological arc, which eventually ends in his death and subsequent apotheosis (deification), where he is granted immortality and a place on Mount Olympus.

3. Preservation of the Ancient Story
The Disney adaptation preserves several surface-level elements from the ancient myth. Character names such as Hercules, Zeus, Hera, Megara, Nessus, and Hades are retained. The overall heroic arc—Hercules facing monstrous foes, undergoing trials, and ultimately achieving divinity—also echoes the original myth. Notably, the concept of apotheosis remains intact: the film ends with Hercules ascending to Mount Olympus after proving himself through acts of self-sacrifice, thus fulfilling the classical motif of the mortal becoming divine.

The film also maintains thematic elements such as heroism, divine ancestry, and the struggle between fate and personal agency. Additionally, Hercules' battle against the centaur Nessus is loosely based on the myth, although it is recontextualized within the romantic subplot between Hercules and Megara.

4. Adaptation & Change
Despite these preserved elements, Disney’s Hercules diverges significantly from the myth in both plot and characterization. The most dramatic changes involve Hercules' parentage and motivations. In the film, Hercules is portrayed as the son of both Zeus and Hera—removing the infidelity central to the original myth and softening Hera’s character from a vengeful antagonist to a loving mother. This change reflects Disney's intention to create a family-friendly narrative and remove morally complex themes like divine jealousy and infanticide.

Hercules’ reason for undertaking heroic acts is also transformed. In Greek mythology, Herakles performs the Twelve Labors as penance for the murder of his family, an act committed under Hera’s manipulation. In contrast, the Disney version omits this dark origin entirely. Hercules is instead motivated by a desire to reclaim his place among the gods and to earn personal glory. The “labors” become a montage of monster battles, stripped of the underlying guilt and redemption that define Herakles’ mythological journey.

Another major alteration is the character of Megara. In the myth, Herakles’ wife Megara is a tragic figure murdered by her husband. In Disney’s version, Megara (Meg) is reimagined as a witty, independent woman working for Hades and ultimately becomes Hercules’ love interest. Their relationship follows a romantic comedy trajectory rather than a tragic arc, making the film more appealing to a younger audience.

The film’s climax also departs from classical sources. Instead of dying and being granted immortality posthumously, Hercules voluntarily jumps into the Underworld to save Meg’s soul, an act of self-sacrifice that restores his godhood. This scene is a significant narrative invention that aligns more closely with modern cinematic tropes of romantic heroism than with ancient Greek beliefs about death and divinity.

5. Interpretation & Meaning
Disney’s adaptation transforms the myth of Herakles into a coming-of-age story centered on personal growth, identity, and love. While the original myth emphasizes atonement, fate, and the wrath of the gods, the film reframes Hercules’ journey as a pursuit of belonging and self-worth. The idea of "what makes a true hero" becomes a central theme—Disney defines heroism not by strength or fame, but by sacrifice and compassion. This moral lesson aligns with contemporary values and resonates with younger audiences.

The film also reflects broader cultural shifts in how myths are consumed and understood. In the 1990s, animation was evolving as a medium for complex storytelling, and Hercules embodies this shift by blending ancient narrative frameworks with modern sensibilities. Its lighthearted tone, humorous dialogue, gospel-inspired soundtrack, and stylized animation make it accessible, entertaining, and distinctly American. By adapting the myth for mass appeal, Disney introduces Greek mythology to new generations while also reshaping its meaning.

Hercules’ apotheosis in the film thus becomes symbolic not just of divine elevation, but of human maturity—emphasizing moral character over birthright. This mirrors contemporary ideals that value meritocracy and emotional intelligence over inherited status. In a modern society where identity and self-actualization are central themes, Disney’s Hercules reframes ancient heroism in ways that are aspirational and culturally relevant.

Conclusion
Disney’s Hercules significantly alters the original myth but retains its emotional and thematic essence. By changing key plot points and character dynamics, the film delivers a story that aligns with modern values while still echoing classical themes. Hercules' apotheosis, reimagined through the lens of love and sacrifice, serves as a powerful vehicle for exploring heroism in a contemporary context. This reception project reveals not just how myths are adapted, but why: to reflect the hopes, fears, and ideals of the societies that retell them.
