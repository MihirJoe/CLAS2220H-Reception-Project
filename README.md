# Cinematic Labors: How Disney Reshaped the Myth of Hercules

This repository contains the interactive web presentation for my reception project for the Classical Mythology Honors course (CLAS 2220H) at The Ohio State University. The project analyzes how Disney's 1997 animated film "Hercules" adapts and transforms the classical myth of Herakles.

## Project Overview

This interactive presentation explores the relationship between ancient Greek mythology and modern popular entertainment through Disney's "Hercules" as a case study. It examines:

- How Disney preserved certain mythological elements
- What significant changes were made to the original myth
- Why these adaptations were made
- How the film reflects contemporary values

## Interactive Features

This presentation includes several interactive elements to enhance the learning experience:

- **Sticky Navigation**: Highlights the current section as you scroll
- **Theme Tracker**: Visual indicator showing progression through key themes (Identity, Heroism, Sacrifice)
